## Description

The Employee Tracker is a command-line application that allows users to manage employee information within a company. It provides functionality to view all departments, roles, and employees, as well as add new departments, roles, and employees. Additionally, users can update an employee's role.

The Employee Tracker application is built using Node.js and MySQL. It utilizes the Inquirer package for the command-line interface and MySQL2 package for interacting with the MySQL database. By completing this project, I have gained practical experience in using JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, and working with databases.
